/* A friend function of a class is defined outside the class's scope, yet has
the right to access non-public (and public) members of the class. Standalone
finctions, entire classes or member functions of other classes may be declared
to be friends of another class. Using friends is often appropriate when a
member fucntion cannot be used for certain operations */
