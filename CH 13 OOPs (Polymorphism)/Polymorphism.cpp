/*
Polymorphism allows you to 'Program in the general' rather than 'Program in the specific'.
It allows you to programs that process objects of classes that are part of the same hierarchy.
as if they were all objects of classes that are part of the same class hierarchy's base
class.
N.B. Polymorphism works off base class pointer handles and base-class reference pointers,
but not off-name handles.
