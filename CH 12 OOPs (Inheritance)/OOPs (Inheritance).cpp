/*
A class can inherit member data from other classes. C++ offers three types of inhertance;
1. Public.
2. Private
3. Protected.

The class from which it's member data is inherited from is called base class
while the class which inherits this members is called derived class, other
languages like java and C# refer to them as superclass and subclass respectively.

As a general rule that does not always hold true:
Base classes tend to be more general while derived classes tend to be more
specic

Example:
Base Class 			Derived Class
1. Student			Undergraduate, Graduate
2. Shape			Circle, Triangle, Square etc.
3. Gender			Male, Female

With single inheritance, a class is derived from one base class.
With multple inheritance, a class is derived from more than one base class

There are two types of base classes:
1. Direct base class which is inherited directly by other classes.
2. Indirect base class which is inherited indirectly from other classes
